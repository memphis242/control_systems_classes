#control_systems_classes

### Summary
This repo is meant to hold any of the MATLAB/Simulink I did over the course of two of my controls-related classes here at North Dakota State University: ECE461 - Control Systems and ECE463 - Modern Control. ECE461 consisted primarily of using root-locus methods to design compensators for various SISO systems. ECE463 was about more modern control methods using state feedback, servo compensators, state observers, kalman-filters (kind-of), and LQR methods for designing controllers. I will say that these were **two of my favorite classes of all time, along with my Applied Digital Signal Processing class.**  

### What Types of Problems Were Encounted In These Classes


### Structure of This Repo and How To Navigate Through
There are a lot of MATLAB function files spread all throughout, along with image files and pdfs. This makes the repo as it stands as of 10/30/2021 *pretty messy*. I do not have time to organize it at the moment, but plan to get to it as soon as I can. For now, however, I think it will be most useful to go into ECE46x and look at the HWx folders, as they have titles that give a general idea of what the assignment was for. I also have my homework submissions scanned, with the problems written out for each one, so that you can see my solution and relevant MATLAB/Simulink programs for each problem.  

Please contact me if you have any questions, or would like to know if there is a particular concept I know/don't know based on what you see!
